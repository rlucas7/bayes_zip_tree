This is a repository for the manuscript I am working on that grew out of my thesis. 

This manuscript studies the efficacy of altering the decision tree structure to 
accommodate zero-inflated Poisson response data and fit the tree in a Bayesian 
framework using an MCMC algorithm. 

In the process I am developing code to turn into a collection of R functions 
for researchers to use the method in their applications.
